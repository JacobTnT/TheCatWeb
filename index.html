  <h2 class = 'x'> Chatper 1 Their Life, Part 1, As a Kitten 1-12 months old</h2>  
  <p> There are 4 stages, Let's start with stage 1 Neonatal</p>
  <div>
    <button class = "mad">
      <img class="star" src = "File101/starJACOB.jpg" height = "30px">
      <p class = "johnson"> If you don't know what neonatal means, back in Greek times neo was new, And the other word natal (or natus) meaning to be born. So neonatal meant newborn. </p>
    </button>
    <p>On the first days, your kitten mostly sleeps. After on on the next few days the cat starts developing their senses. First the hearing, then the sight.</p>
    <p>Then, growth seems the be slower. On the last few days the kittens start to crawl </p>
    <p>Growth is fast after that, First playing, So. 5 days later, you can stop giving kitty formula</p>
    <button class = "mad">
      <img class="star" src = "File101/starJACOB.jpg" height = "30px">
      <p class = "johnson"> Really, I mean it. After the first month of the cat’s life you need to switch to adult cat food </p>
      <p class = "johnson">But, not all cats can easily transition. Purina “recommends to switch to adult food over a 7-10 day period” ( P.S: If you see any plagiarism, let us know in a email. )</p>
      <h5>You can start litter box training in the first month of the cat's life </h5>
    <p>If you do not want to go there congrats! We will nicely make a button on top of the screen.</p>
  </div>
   <div>
      <p>Still the young two-week old kittens sleep.. </p>
      <p class = "large"> Stage 2: Socialization</p>
      <p>Just a day later the kittens start having fun with toys </p>
      <p>The day after the kittens can remove wastefulness</p>
      <p>In the third week, The body can move with no more wobbliness! </p>
      <p> Lots of play means sleepy kittens! </p>
      <button class = "mad">
        <img class="star" src = "File101/starJACOB.jpg" height = "30px">
                <p class = "johnson"> Never interrupt a cat sleeping</p>
        </button>
      <p> More happens in the third week which we will tell you about</p>
      <p> On the third week, the kittens will have teeth too.</p>
      <p> This is 1 month 16.4% percent there</p>
      <p> Socialization are key factors because it will help them in the early junior stage</p>
      <p>At 5 weeks, your cat/kitten can have it's own personality, It may take longer if your cat is a British Shorthair or a Persian or a Ragdoll cat breeds </p>
      <p> Or it can be earlier if you have a Siamese, Bengal and a Abyssinian cat breed</p>
      <p> They have balance, and now decent at tidying.</p>
      <p> If you were in the vet working to take care of the kitten, they are almost weaned.
        A day later, you can give them scratch posts.
      </p>
      <p> In the 2nd month, they can have 1.5 pounds to 2.6 pounds. As we can see, the 2 pound guineline may take longer for other cats, while shorter for other cats</p>
      <p> As we wait the last days we find hat the cats are doing more complex things.</p>
      <p>If your cat is a smaller breed or looked at Reddit finding someone saying 12 weeks <span class = "Me">minimum</span></p>
      <p> Or you just adopted the cat! Now you can see the progress, Anyway the eye color is fair, your cat probably has a different eye than their neighbor. </p>
      <p>After, progress starts to be slower. Weeks go by.</p>
      <p>13th week: They are now more confident and this is their play peak</p>
      <p>15th to 8th month: The cat's more certain and exploring</p>
                                                             
      <p>As we lean to the 12th month we have more independence and devolpment grows, Their personality becomes more solid, and play becomes more interactive. Then they have adult-like attitudes. Once we reach the 11th to 12th month, their can be hunting attitudes. </p>
      <h5>Our data sources are from alleycat.org and Gemini</h5>
   </div>
   
  <h2 class="genz"> Chatper 2, As a Junior 1-2 years old</h3>
    <p> Your cat is offically a adult (15 years old in human years)</p>
    <p> Your cat can play, but not ALL the time. *My cat usually plays
      at night.* Or always in the day and never at the night. Or both!
      Anyways, please give you cat a daily vet checkup.
    </p>
  <p>The personality is made, but there may be devolpment</p>
  <p>The personality is made and used, the personality is a random
    number genenator of 1 *always tired and never plays* or *never tired and always
    plays* or in the middle.
  </p>
  <p> But every cat is its own person.</p>
  <p class = "largeman"> 2 Years Old</p>
  <p> At this age, your cat is a young adult, the cat is all mature.</p>
  <p> They now have rountines. And if you treat the cat good, i'll treat you good</p>
  <p>Well while 3-year olds always touch things the cat may prepare for revenge</p>
  <p> And please do regular vet check-ups</p>
  <h3 class = 'brainRot'> Chatper 3, Adult Age 3 to 10 years old</h3>
   <p>At this age, the cat becomes less playful. And flashbacks "never interrupt a cat sleeping"
    has planned not to give you social interaction. But if you did read "never interrupt a cat sleeping"
    and applied that. It can give you social interaction. They usually sleep and grooming.
   </p>
   <p class = "ahh"> Four Years Old</p>
   <p> The grooming sessions grows and with exploration too!</p>
   <p class = "ahh"> Five Years Old</p>
   <p> This gets more important,  Gemini tells you to "maintain a healthy weight"</p>
   <p class = "ahh">Six Years Old</p> 
   <p> Start dental care.  Gemini recommends "cat's teeth or using dental chews"</p>
   <p class = "ahh"> Seven Years Old</p>
   <p>The cat's playfulness declines with sleep *kinda* taking over</p>

  <p class = "ahh">Eight Years Old</p>
  <p>In the ages 7-9 years old your cat is in the midlife stage, not too sleepy, not too playful. </p>
  <p>At this age your cat may or may not have a virus. <span class = "bebefin">Must take vet vists</span></p>
  <p>Change diet to a senior diet but talk to your vet about that. </p>
 <p class = "ahh"> Nine Years Old </p>
 <p>Yippee! your cat is a senior!</p>
<p>  Socialization can be random, more dependent and less dependent</p>
<p>Gromming plumments, and with as Gemini "Potential Health Concerns:
  Age-related health issues may start to appear, such as arthritis, kidney disease, or hyperthyroidism."</p>
<p class = "ahh">Ten Years Old</p>
<p> Maybe your kids are thinking of all the times with your cat, wishing to see the cat or you literally just adopted the cat</p>
<p> Do dental care, senior cat food, checkups. All that. </p>
  <h3 class = 'Webdev'> Chatper 4, Senior Age, 11-14 years old</h3>
   <p>You may think it's a bit tiring to go to these checkups, but this is just the start trust me...</p>
   <p>Age 12: Gemini "changes in behavior such as confusion or disorientation."</p>
   <p>Age 13-14: Vet checks, dental. Don't worry. Keep marching forward *Not in vet checks, it's a confidence boost okay?</p>
  <h3 class = 'genAlpha'> Chatper 5, Geriatric. 15 years to 26 years </h3>
   <p> I told you, it's sad but true. The cat's lose their hearing and vision could happen</p>
   <p> Vet checks every 3 months or as recommended from your vet. Give your cat the most comfort as possible</p>
   <p> 16 years old: Good job to coming and using the tips from this website! Vision and hearing loss may have happen</p>
   <p> And some cats may need a vet checkup every month</p>
