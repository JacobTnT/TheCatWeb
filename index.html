  <h1> Part 2, The Body</h1>
  <p> When cats grow older the body gets older, Slowly but surely your cats bones
    will get older. It is important to keep your cat healthy. But anyways lets 
    move on.
  </p>
  <h3 class ='red'> Chatper 1, Part 2. Head</h3>
  
  <p> Whiskers: Most of a cat's whiskers grow on the face, The cat's 
    muzzle, above the eye and cheek, All grow whiskers. On each muzzle of 
    most cats, There are 4 rows of 12 whiskers which is 48 whiskers total.
  </p>
   <p> Muzzle: A cat muzzle is a guard made of straps/wire that goes over a cat's 
  nose and mouth to prevent it from biting, Muzzles can be used on a lot of siuations
   </p>
<p> Foreheads: Cats have foreheads for many reasons, including scent glands, affection and 
  markings. And yes we can never forget the back of a cat's head on some call
  a nape. The nape contains losse skin known as a scruff. This non-aware area of skin is used by
  mother cat to carry kittens with teeth.
</p>

<h3 class ='z'> Cat Ears,  Phase 1</h3>
<li> Ear tufts: Cat ear tufts are the fur 
  that grows from the tips of the ears, Cat ear tufts work to help
  to get sound directly to the cat's ears</li>
  <ol>

<li> The outer ear includes the pinna and the ear canal. The pinna is
  shaped to grab sound waves and tunnel them past the ear canal to the 
  eardrum.
</li>

<li> Ear furnshings are hairs play a major role in maintaining  ear health 
  by providing a barrier to help prevent a variety of things from infiltarting
  the sensitive ear canal.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class ='y'> Phase 2, Cat Eyes</h3>
  <ol>

  <li>Eyelashes: Eyelashes in cats, like other animals. Help protect the eyes 
    from harm. Can be used as dust catchers, keeping debris out of the eyes.
    That could cause harm, injury, infection, or destory vision. Trust me,
    Keep your cat out from those things. 
  </li>
  <li> A cats pupil, the black spot in the middle of it's eye, controls
    how much light enters the eye. The pupil closes or opens to let less
    or more light. 
  </li>
  </ol>


<p>Nictitating Membrane</p><li>: Cats have a third eyelid to bring a added
  layer of protection and keep the keeps moist while still allowing
to see normal. The nictitaing membrane is not usually seeable 
unless any bad condition is here. </li>


<ul>
<li>Iris: The colored, circular area around the pupil controls the 
  total light that enters the eye by making the pupil bigger or smaller.
</li>

  of the eyeball thats supports its shape and helps it from injury.

  to the edge of the of the cornea and patches the inside of the eyelid.

  called the limbus. The cornea is at four layers, Firstly The Anterior Epithellium
  which is attached to its own basement membrane. The Stroma, which makes up 90%
  of corneal thickness which means barely 5% for the rest of the layers. 
</li>
