    <h2 class='x'>Chatper 1 Their Life, Part 1, As a Kitten 1-12 months old</h2>
    <p>There are 4 stages, Let's start with stage 1 Neonatal</p>

    <div class="mad">
        <img class="star" src="File101/starJACOB.jpg" height="30px" alt="Star">
        <p class="johnson">If you don't know what neonatal means, back in Greek times neo was new, And the other word natal (or natus) meaning to be born. So neonatal meant newborn.</p>
        <a href="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT8spese3oKFhaWGfQsyI_F7oMyd__YjnYtc6PP_njup7BkWiC0sNri_jOXoy-o">
            Image</a>
    </div>
    <p>On the first days, your kitten mostly sleeps. After on on the next few days the cat starts developing their senses.
        First the hearing, then the sight.</p>
    <p>Then, growth seems the be slower. On the last few days the kittens start to crawl</p>
    <p>Growth is fast after that, First playing, So. 5 days later, you can stop giving kitty formula</p>
    <div class="mad">
        <img class="star" src="File101/starJACOB.jpg" height="30px" alt="Star">
        <p class="johnson">Really, I mean it. After the first month of the cat’s life you need to switch to adult cat food</p>
        <p class="johnson">But, not all cats can easily transition. Purina “recommends to switch to adult food over a 7-10 day
            period” ( P.S: If you see any plagiarism, let us know in a email. )</p>
        <h5>You can start litter box training in the first month of the cat's life</h5>
        <p>If you do not want to go there congrats! We will nicely make a button on top of the screen.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Still the young two-week old kittens sleep.. </p>
        <p class="large">Stage 2: Socialization</p>
        <p>Just a day later the kittens start having fun with toys </p>
        <p>The day after the kittens can remove wastefulness</p>
        <p>In the third week, The body can move with no more wobbliness! </p>
        <p>Lots of play means sleepy kittens! </p>
        <div class="mad">
            <img class="star" src="File101/starJACOB.jpg" height="30px" alt="Star">
            <p class="johnson">Never interrupt a cat sleeping</p>
        </div>
        <p>More happens in the third week which we will tell you about</p>
        <p>On the third week, the kittens will have teeth too.</p>
        <p>This is 1 month 16.4% percent there</p>
        <p>Socialization are key factors because it will help them in the early junior stage</p>
        <p>At 5 weeks, your cat/kitten can have it's own personality, It may take longer if your cat is a British Shorthair
            or a Persian or a Ragdoll cat breeds </p>
        <p>Or it can be earlier if you have a Siamese, Bengal and a Abyssinian cat breed</p>
        <p>They have balance, and now decent at tidying.</p>
        <p>If you were in the vet working to take care of the kitten, they are almost weaned.
            A day later, you can give them scratch posts.
        </p>
        <p>In the 2nd month, they can have 1.5 pounds to 2.6 pounds. As we can see, the 2 pound guineline may take longer
            for other cats, while shorter for other cats</p>
        <p>As we wait the last days we find hat the cats are doing more complex things.</p>
        <p>If your cat is a smaller breed or looked at Reddit finding someone saying 12 weeks <span class="Me">minimum</span></p>
        <p>Or you just adopted the cat! Now you can see the progress, Anyway the eye color is fair, your cat probably has a
            different eye than their neighbor. </p>
        <p>After, progress starts to be slower. Weeks go by.</p>
        <p>13th week: They are now more confident and this is their play peak</p>
        <p>15th to 8th month: The cat's more certain and exploring</p>

        <p>As we lean to the 12th month we have more independence and devolpment grows, Their personality becomes more
            solid, and play becomes more interactive. Then they have adult-like attitudes. Once we reach the 11th to 12th
            month, their can be hunting attitudes. </p>

    <h2 class="genz">Chatper 2, As a Junior 1-2 years old</h2>
    <p>Your cat is offically a adult (15 years old in human years)</p>
    <p>Your cat can play, but not ALL the time. *My cat usually plays
        at night.* Or always in the day and never at the night. Or both!
        Anyways, please give you cat a daily vet checkup.
    </p>
    <p>The personality is made, but there may be devolpment</p>
    <p>The personality is made and used, the personality is a random
        number genenator of 1 *always tired and never plays* or *never tired and always
        plays* or in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>But every cat is its own person.</p>
    <p class="largeman">2 Years Old</p>
    <p>At this age, your cat is a young adult, the cat is all mature.</p>
    <p>They now have rountines. And if you treat the cat good, i'll treat you good</p>
    <p>Well while 3-year olds always touch things the cat may prepare for revenge</p>
    <p>And please do regular vet check-ups</p>
    <h3 class='brainRot'>Chatper 3, Adult Age 3 to 10 years old</h3>
    <p>At this age, the cat becomes less playful. And flashbacks "never interrupt a cat sleeping"
        has planned not to give you social interaction. But if you did read "never interrupt a cat sleeping"
        and applied that. It can give you social interaction. They usually sleep and grooming.
    </p>
    <p class="ahh">Four Years Old</p>
    <p>The grooming sessions grows and with exploration too!</p>
    <p class="ahh">Five Years Old</p>
    <p>This gets more important, Gemini tells you to "maintain a healthy weight"</p>
    <p class="ahh">Six Years Old</p>
    <p>Start dental care. Gemini recommends "cat's teeth or using dental chews"</p>
    <p class="ahh">Seven Years Old</p>
    <p>The cat's playfulness declines with sleep *kinda* taking over</p>

    <p class="ahh">Eight Years Old</p>
    <p>In the ages 7-9 years old your cat is in the midlife stage, not too sleepy, not too playful. </p>
    <p>At this age your cat may or may not have a virus. <span class="bebefin">Must take vet vists</span></p>
    <p>Change diet to a senior diet but talk to your vet about that. </p>
    <p class="ahh">Nine Years Old </p>
    <p>Yippee! your cat is a senior!</p>
    <p>Socialization can be random, more dependent and less dependent</p>
    <p>Gromming plumments, and with as Gemini "Potential Health Concerns:
        Age-related health issues may start to appear, such as arthritis, kidney disease, or hyperthyroidism."</p>
    <p class="ahh">Ten Years Old</p>
    <p>Maybe your kids are thinking of all the times with your cat, wishing to see the cat or you literally just adopted
        the cat</p>
    <p>Do dental care, senior cat food, checkups. All that. </p>
    <h3 class='Webdev'>Chatper 4, Senior Age, 11-14 years old</h3>
    <p>You may think it's a bit tiring to go to these checkups, but this is just the start trust me...</p>
