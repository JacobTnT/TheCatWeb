        <h2> A Good Daily Rountine For Cats</h2>
        <p> When I mean by good, I don't mean like waiting 73 hours to give your cat food, or anything else.</p>
        <p>What I mean is that this helps your cat live as long as possible</p>
        <p> Let's get a move on.</p>
      
       <h3> Phase 1: Feeding </h3>
       <li>Normal Feeding Times: Feed your cat at the same times every day or, at least try if you are busy.</li>
       <h3> Phase 2: Playtime</h3>
       <p> Play with your cat at least 15-20 minutes daily, or try if busy</p>
       <h3> Phase 3: Grooming</h3>
       <p>Regularly brush your cat to not have loose hair.</p>
       <h3> Phase 4: Litter Box Care</h3>
       <p>Clean the litter box daily and disinfect it weekly. Or try if busy</p>
       <h3> Phase 5: Vet Care</h3>
       <p> Schedule regular vet check-ups and vaccinations. Or try if busy</p>
       <h3> Phase 6: Rest and Relaxing</h3>
       <p> Before I start, I know most of you always need rest and relax, Because then you could feel grumpy and random.</p>
      <li>Provide a quiet, comfy space for your cat to rest.</li>
